In Google Sheets, A2:H refers to a range of cells:

A2 specifies the starting cell in column A, row 2.
H specifies all cells in columns up to and including column H.
So, A2:H includes all cells from A2 through H2 down to the last row of data in columns A to H.

This range would look like:

Starting cell: A2
Ending cell: H (through the last row in these columns)
If you want to select a specific range, for example, from A2 to H10, you would use A2:H10
